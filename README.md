# CrossHair
C# super basic Greenish crosshair overlay for FPS games on Windows 10.
Tested on 1920*1080@120Hz with no issue.

Mainly done for Fortnite but must be usable on any game with centered crosshair.
Just extract Zip from release and launch the exe.

You can ofc tweak it to your liking by modifying both MainWindow files.
